#  HNG Frontend Stage 0 — Testable Profile Card

This project is part of the **HNG Internship (Frontend Track, Stage 0)**.  
The goal is to build a **responsive and accessible Profile Card** using only **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** — with every visible element containing the required `data-testid` attributes for automated testing.

---

##  Task Overview

I built a small Profile Card that displays:
-  My name
-  A short bio
-  The current time (in milliseconds)
-  A profile image (avatar)
-  My social links
-  A list of my hobbies
-  A list of my dislikes

Each element follows the exact naming rules (like `data-testid="test-user-name"`) so tests can find them easily.
